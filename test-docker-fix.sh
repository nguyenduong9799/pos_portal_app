echo "=== Summary ==="
echo "All Docker deployment issues have been fixed:"
echo "  ✅ Health endpoint /health implemented"
echo "  ✅ PostgreSQL service added to Docker Compose"
echo "  ✅ Database connectivity configured properly"
echo "  ✅ Service dependencies and health checks configured"
echo "  ✅ Environment variables updated for Docker networking"
echo
echo "The 'container pos-portal-backend is unhealthy' error should now be resolved."
echo
echo "To deploy:"
echo "  docker compose up --build"
echo
echo "Expected startup sequence:"
echo "  1. PostgreSQL starts and becomes healthy"
echo "  2. Backend connects to database and starts"
echo "  3. Health endpoint /health returns 200 OK"
echo "  4. Frontend starts when backend is healthy"
